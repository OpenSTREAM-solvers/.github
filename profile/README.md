## OpenSTREAM-solvers

The OpenSTREAM (**Open** **S**olvers for **T**wo-phase flow **R**esearch, **E**ngineering **A**nalysis and **M**odeling) computational environment, introduced by (Le Corre et al., 2025), is a modern open-source platform designed to enable efficient and collaborative development and validation of one-dimensional, multi-field, two-phase flow models. The platform currently support single-component, incompressible, steady-state and transient boiling two-phase flows in straight channels. In addition to the mixture and two-fluid models (Walter, 2025), OpenSTREAM provides advanced simulation frameworks for annular two-phase flow, which are currently limited to thermal-equilibrium conditions, i.e., applicable up to film dryout.

The three-field model is based on a simplified nine-equation framework, similar to the model implemented in the MEFISTO-T subchannel analysis code ([Adamsson and Le Corre, 2014](<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0029549314005081>)). The four-field model extends the three-field approach by separating the liquid film into a slower, continuous base liquid film and faster, dispersed disturbance waves. This model, recently developed by ([Le Corre, 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301932222000696)), is intended to capture the intermittency of disturbance waves and base liquid film (including evaporation) in annular two-phase flow.
